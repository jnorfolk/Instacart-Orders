Practicum Sprint 2 Project - EDA

This is the 2nd project I worked on during my Practicum data science program.
This project was the most independent project I've worked on so far in the data 
space. I loved it. I explored the dataset to find and fix missing and duplicate values, and I worked on merging dataframes and analyzing data through visualizations and pivot tables. 

Working on describing my project at each step was very valuable to me, as I never had to do that before. I wrote an introduction and conclusion that outlined what I did, and made suggestions to the business.
